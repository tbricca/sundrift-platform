# Workspace Visual Design Contract

Use this file as the workspace-level visual brief. App-specific directions
belong in each app's `DESIGN.md`; shared workspace chrome should remain
semantic and neutral unless the workspace has an explicit brand system.

## Shared product context

- Audience and cadence: internal Sundrift team (fictional travel ecommerce for
  luggage and bags), plus editorial drafts for travelers.
- Brand voice: practical and brief.
- Environment: Agent Native defaults for layout, components, chrome, and type.
- Shared anti-references: reskinning apps. Accent tokens in
  `packages/shared/styles/tokens.css` are reserved for a later storefront.

## Sibling direction ledger

Record each app's chosen direction so a workspace can stay coherent without
making every app look cloned.

| App | Mode | Direction | Palette family |
| --- | ---- | --------- | -------------- |
|     |      |           |                |

## App direction rule

Each new app chooses a named visual world before styling. Record its product
mode, palette family, type treatment, composition, shape language, and
anti-references in the app's `DESIGN.md`. Keep behavior and semantic tokens
consistent across apps, but do not reuse the same accent family and page
composition by default.

Never copy a sibling's `global.css` palette block or let the most recently
generated app become the workspace default.

Read `.agents/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md` and its
`references/visual-direction.md` before designing a new surface.
