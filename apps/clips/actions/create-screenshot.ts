/**
 * Create a screenshot: one still image stored as a `kind='image'` recording.
 *
 * Unlike a video there is nothing to stream, so this is a single call — the
 * browser captures a frame, encodes it, and posts the bytes as a data URL. The
 * server does the upload itself (rather than trusting a client-supplied URL)
 * so `imageUrl` always points at our own storage, then inserts the row already
 * `ready`: no chunked upload, no finalize, no transcript or filmstrip to wait
 * for.
 *
 * The row is an ordinary recording in every other respect, which is the point:
 * it lands in the same library and inherits sharing, share passwords, expiry,
 * folders, spaces, tags and comments without new code.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   pnpm action create-screenshot --dataUrl="data:image/jpeg;base64,..." \
 *     --width=2560 --height=1440
