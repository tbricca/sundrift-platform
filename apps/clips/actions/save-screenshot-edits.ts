/**
 * Save a screenshot's edits, and burn its redactions in when asked.
 *
 * Redaction works the way it does on a video, in two steps:
 *
 * 1. **Placing.** Redaction boxes are saved as data in `editsJson.overlays`,
 *    in the video editor's own format, and stay movable. Nothing is destroyed
 *    — the unmarked original is kept as the base — so while any are waiting
 *    the screenshot is held back from everyone who cannot edit it, by the same
 *    checks that hold a clip (`server/lib/pending-redactions.ts`).
 * 2. **Burning in.** The client sends `baseDataUrl`: the picture with the
 *    redactions destroyed and no marks. It becomes the new base, the previous
 *    files are deleted, the pending list is cleared — which lifts the hold —
 *    and the title gains the same "(Redacted)" marker a burned clip does. If a
 *    delete fails the action fails: claiming a redaction while the unredacted
 *    original is still fetchable is the one outcome worth refusing.
 *
 * Between those writes the row carries a burn-in-progress marker listing the
 * files still to delete (`server/lib/pending-redactions.ts`). It holds the
 * screenshot on its own, so the hold never depends on the boxes having been
 * saved as pending first, and every other save is refused until it clears.
 *
 * A burn has no undo. Burned regions are recorded (where, never what).
