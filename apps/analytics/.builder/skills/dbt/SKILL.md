# dbt Integration

## Project Location

- **Root**: `dbt/` (in workspace root, NOT in code/)
- **Models**: `dbt/models/` organized by layer (staging, intermediate, mart, analytics)
- **Config**: `dbt/dbt_project.yml`
- **Profiles**: `dbt/profiles.yml`

## Access Control

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: The dbt directory has restricted write access. When creating or modifying dbt models:

1. Create SQL in `code/.builder/dbt-models/` first
2. Test the query using a script in `code/scripts/`
3. Validate results before requesting deployment
4. User must manually copy to `dbt/models/` directory

## Schema Organization

| Schema                 | Purpose                                    | Examples                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `dbt_staging_bigquery` | Raw staged events from BigQuery            | `first_pageviews`, `all_pageviews`, `signups`          |
| `dbt_staging`          | Raw staged data from other sources         | `hubspot_companies`, `hubspot_contacts`                |
| `dbt_intermediate`     | Joins, transforms, denormalization         | `hubspot_form_submissions`, `deal_first_contact`       |
| `dbt_mapping`          | Join tables, ID mappings                   | `hs_deals_to_contact_id`, `user_id_to_org_id`          |
| `dbt_mart`             | Dimensional models (fact/dim tables)       | `dim_hs_deals`, `dim_hs_contacts`, `dim_subscriptions` |
| `dbt_analytics`        | Reporting views, aggregates                | `deals_by_motion`, `revenue_funnel`, `active_users`    |
| `dbt_dev`              | Development/testing (EXCLUDE from queries) | Auto-filtered by BigQuery lib                          |

## Model Configuration Best Practices

### Standard config block

```sql
{{
    config(
        schema="dbt_analytics",          -- Target schema
        materialized="table",             -- or "view", "incremental"
        tags=["daily", "analytics", "hubspot"],  -- For orchestration/docs
    )
}}
```

### Common materializations

- `table` - Full refresh daily, good for < 10M rows
- `view` - No storage, always fresh, good for simple transforms
- `incremental` - Append-only, for large event tables

## SQL Patterns & Gotchas

### 1. Column Name Mismatches

⚠️ **Common bug source**: Column names differ between spec and actual tables

| Spec Column           | Actual Column              | Table             |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `first_pageview_date` | `created_date` (TIMESTAMP) | `first_pageviews` |
| `channel`             | `first_touch_channel`      | `all_pageviews`   |
| `referrer`            | `c_referrer`               | `all_pageviews`   |
| `user_create_date`    | `user_create_d`            | `product_signups` |
| `deal_stage`          | `stage_name`               | `dim_hs_deals`    |
| `deal_amount`         | `amount`                   | `dim_hs_deals`    |

**Always verify column names** by querying `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` or reading the source dbt model.

### 2. ARRAY_AGG Syntax

❌ **WRONG** (DISTINCT + ORDER BY non-argument):

```sql
ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT form_name IGNORE NULLS ORDER BY form_fill_date LIMIT 1)
```

✅ **CORRECT** (remove DISTINCT or order by same column):

```sql
-- Option 1: Remove DISTINCT (ORDER BY creates uniqueness)
ARRAY_AGG(form_name IGNORE NULLS ORDER BY form_fill_date LIMIT 1)[SAFE_OFFSET(0)]

-- Option 2: Order by the aggregated column
ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT form_name ORDER BY form_name LIMIT 1)[SAFE_OFFSET(0)]
```

### 3. Type Casting

BigQuery dbt models store booleans as strings in some tables. Always cast:

```sql
-- dim_hs_deals.is_closed_won is STRING 'true'/'false', not BOOL
CASE WHEN CAST(is_closed_won AS STRING) = 'true' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END

-- Amounts may be STRING, cast to numeric
SUM(CAST(amount AS FLOAT64))
```

### 4. Email Matching

Always use case-insensitive email matching:

```sql
LOWER(qf.email) = LOWER(c.email)
```

### 5. QUALIFY for Deduplication

Use `QUALIFY` for window function filtering (cleaner than subquery):

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table
QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY deal_id ORDER BY created_date) = 1
```

### 6. NULL-Safe Joins

When joining on potentially NULL columns (like visitor IDs):

```sql
LEFT JOIN forms f
  ON (
    LOWER(f.email) = LOWER(c.email)
    OR (f.b_visitor_id IS NOT NULL AND f.b_visitor_id = c.b_visitor_id)
  )
```

## Common Join Paths

### HubSpot Deals → Contacts → Forms

```sql
FROM {{ ref("dim_hs_deals") }} d
LEFT JOIN {{ ref("hs_deals_to_contact_id") }} dc
  ON d.deal_id = dc.deal_id
LEFT JOIN {{ ref("dim_hs_contacts") }} c
  ON dc.contact_id = c.contact_id
LEFT JOIN {{ ref("hubspot_form_submissions") }} f
  ON LOWER(f.email) = LOWER(c.email)
  AND f.form_fill_date < d.createdate
```

**Key points**:

- `hs_deals_to_contact_id` unnests the `associatedcontactids` JSON array
- Multiple contacts per deal → need aggregation or `QUALIFY` to dedupe
- Match contacts to forms by email AND/OR `b_visitor_id`
- Timestamp filter (`form_fill_date < deal.createdate`) for attribution

### Visitor → Signup → Subscription

```sql
FROM {{ ref("first_pageviews") }} fp
LEFT JOIN {{ ref("signups") }} s
  ON fp.visitor_id = s.visitor_id
LEFT JOIN {{ ref("dim_subscriptions") }} sub
  ON s.root_organization_id = sub.root_id
```

### Contact → User → Organization

```sql
-- Use product_signups for user data
FROM {{ ref("dim_hs_contacts") }} c
LEFT JOIN {{ ref("product_signups") }} ps
  ON LOWER(ps.email) = LOWER(c.email)
  OR (ps.user_id IS NOT NULL AND ps.user_id = c.builder_user_id)
LEFT JOIN {{ ref("dim_root_organizations") }} ro
  ON ps.user_id = ro.user_id -- or use appropriate join key
WHERE ps.user_create_d IS NOT NULL
```

**Important**: Use `dbt_analytics.product_signups` for signup data - it has the most complete user coverage. Match on both email and user_id for best results.

## Testing Queries Before Creating Models

**Always test SQL before creating dbt model**:

1. Create test script in `code/scripts/test-<feature>.sql`
2. Write BigQuery SQL with fully qualified table names:
   ```sql
   FROM `your-project-id.dbt_mart.dim_hs_deals`
   ```
3. Create runner script in `code/scripts/test-<feature>.ts`:
   ```typescript
   import { runQuery } from "../server/lib/bigquery";
   import { readFileSync } from "fs";
   const sql = readFileSync("scripts/test-<feature>.sql", "utf-8");
   const result = await runQuery(sql);
   console.log(result.rows);
   ```
4. Run: `pnpm action test-<feature>`
5. Iterate until results are correct
6. Convert to dbt syntax (replace table names with `{{ ref("table") }}`)
7. Save final SQL to `code/.builder/dbt-models/<model_name>.sql`

## Deal Motion Classification Patterns

### Warm Outbound Detection

To detect if a contact had a product signup before deal creation, use `dbt_analytics.product_signups`:

```sql
-- Join to product_signups (match by email OR user_id)
-- AND signup was BEFORE deal creation
LEFT JOIN {{ ref("product_signups") }} ps
  ON (
    LOWER(ps.email) = LOWER(c.email)
    OR (ps.user_id IS NOT NULL AND ps.user_id = c.builder_user_id)
  )
  AND ps.user_create_d < d.createdate
```

**Key columns in product_signups**:

- `user_id` - Builder user ID
- `email` - User email
- `user_create_d` (TIMESTAMP) - Signup/user creation date

**Critical**: Match on **both email AND user_id** with OR logic for complete coverage. `user_create_d` is already TIMESTAMP, no conversion needed.

**Do NOT** use:

- `dbt_staging_bigquery.signups` - incomplete coverage
- `dim_hs_contacts.sign_up_time_stamp` - DATE type, requires conversion and has gaps

### Form Submission Attribution

When attributing form submissions to deals/contacts:

**Qualifying form categories** (based on actual data analysis):

```sql
WHERE (
  -- Sales-related forms
  LOWER(form_name) LIKE '%sales%'
  OR LOWER(conversion_details) LIKE '%sales%'

  -- Demo forms
  OR LOWER(form_name) LIKE '%demo%'
  OR LOWER(conversion_details) LIKE '%demo%'

  -- Specific high-intent forms
  OR form_name = '[Marketing]  | Component Indexing Request'
  OR conversion_details = 'Unlock Ent Trial'
)
```

**Common form names** (March 2026 data):

- `[Marketing] Sales Demo Form | 7.20.23` - 5,803 submissions
- `[Marketing] Sales Demo Form - Unlock Enterprise Features` - 3,971 submissions
- `Demo Library Form` - 1,866 submissions
- `[Marketing]  | Component Indexing Request` - 51 submissions

## Model Documentation

Add to `dbt/models/analytics/_models.yml`:

```yaml
- name: deals_inbound_outbound_motion
  description: >
    Classifies Enterprise deals as Inbound or Outbound based on whether 
    any associated contact filled a qualifying form before deal creation.
  columns:
    - name: deal_id
      description: Unique deal identifier
    - name: deal_motion
      description: "Inbound or Outbound classification"
    - name: qualifying_form_count
      description: "Number of distinct qualifying forms filled by associated contacts"
    - name: first_qualifying_form_name
      description: "Name of earliest qualifying form"
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Byte limits**: BigQuery queries have 750GB byte limit
- **Table size**: `dim_hs_deals` ~3,400 rows, `hubspot_form_submissions` ~20K rows
- **Caching**: 24-hour cache in `server/lib/bigquery.ts`
- **Enterprise filter**: Always filter to Enterprise pipelines early in WHERE clause
- **Avoid**: Unnecessary JOINs, avoid SELECT \* from large tables

## Useful AI Instructions to Add

Based on this analysis, here are additional AI instructions that would be helpful:

1. **Form submission attribution logic** - Document the exact form categories that qualify as "inbound"
2. **Deal-to-contact join patterns** - The unnesting of `associatedcontactids` is non-obvious
3. **Column name mapping reference** - Centralized list of common mismatches
4. **Type casting patterns** - Which fields need CAST and to what type
5. **Email matching best practices** - Always case-insensitive, NULL-safe for visitor IDs
6. **ARRAY_AGG syntax rules** - DISTINCT + ORDER BY gotcha
7. **QUALIFY usage** - Preferred over subquery for window function filtering
8. **Enterprise pipeline filter** - Standard WHERE clause for enterprise deals
